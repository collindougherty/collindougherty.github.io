So said Nick Bostrom, Oxford University theoretical physicist and philosopher. Yeah, about that. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that machine learning doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as advertised in March Madness.\nAll jokes aside, I set out on a hopeful quest to build a predictive model, in the mold of Ken Pomeroy and Jeff Sagarin, to predict my March Madness Bracket for me. Gone were the hours of pouring over stats with paper and pen, or combing through NCAA data online to predict my winners. Now, I could spend an extra 20 hours making a computer do it for me.\nIn order to build my model, I employed the aid of R and hoopR. Without getting too much into the weeds of how I selected variables, the following were employed:\n home/away true shooting% turnover% free throw factor offensive and defensive rebound% field goal% three point% points per possession points per possession allowed scoring margin compared to expectation per game (did you beat that bad team by more than expected, or lose to Gonzaga by less than expected?) block% average possession difference defensive stats for all these  While some of these stats have overlap, my thought process was that if we knew efficiency per possession and total possessions, we could accurately predict the better team. We attempt to find differences in possessions through rebounds and turnovers, and efficiency metrics through shooting and free throw stats. I also included home/away as a variable and defensive versions of every stats, so that predictions account for the quality of defense on each side.\nWith the aid of my new holy grail of predictive variables, I employed a variety of statistical machine learning methods, including a random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and XGboost. While the SVM and XGboost added small fractions of accuracy, the computing power required made pursuing them unrealistic for me, as I hope to be able to update my projections easily mid-season.\nI landed on a simple logistic regression for the tournament, though I would prefer to use the random forest going forward, in order to better handle multi-colinearity. Both the random forest and the logistic regression performed very well on in-season data, accurately predicting the outcome of ~72% of games ahead of time. Per my calculations, this is in the same ballpark as KenPom and Sagarin\u0026rsquo;s ratings.\nOf course, on a 72% accuracy and with so many evenly-matched in the tournament, chaos is bound to happen. My initial bracket:\nMy machine learning model (~72% accuracy) fared well in conference tournaments. Time for the big dance. Percentages represent win probabilities.

Model went 23-16 in matchups it predicted ahead of time (~59%). A far cry from the 72% it put up in the regular season, but that\u0026#39;s probably to be expected in March. Article to come later today https://t.co/4m5RWhw5PF pic.twitter.com/MImGLLsw87\n\u0026mdash; Collin Dougherty (@CollinD0ugherty) April 4, 2022  A performance of 59% on the matchups where I had both team\u0026rsquo;s right isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, but it\u0026rsquo;s a far cry from the 72% of the regular season. I\u0026rsquo;m hesitant to read too much into such a small sample size, but one observation I have made throughout the course of the post-season is a tendency for the model to overvalue teams from non-P6 conferences, such as Vermont and Murray State. Some improvements in how I go about adjusting for strength of schedule should help in this regard for next season.\nAnother consideration is adjusting for pace. We saw several teams struggle against St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s defense as they slowed the pace of the game drastically, allowing them to beat objectively better teams. Of course, no model will predict a team like St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s over Kentucky, but it seems reasonable that a team that uglies up the game should swing win probabilities a bit more in their favor relative to what we would expect. (Conversely, they may also make their win probability lower against teams we expect them to beat. Looking at you Wisconsin.)\nThe South region I predicted relatively well, but Houston\u0026rsquo;s 1 for 20 showing from behind the arc against Villanova likely changed the course of the tournament. Houston, who appeared to be the better team, just couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy a bucket, but that\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of the game. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the ability to predict 72% of games, but there is definitely room for improvement. I look forward to improving the model in the coming months ahead of the 2022 season.\n","date":1649030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649091637,"objectID":"85f4264097f56858ef39cff159da97af","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/how-i-used-machine-learning-to-solve-march-madness/","publishdate":"2022-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/how-i-used-machine-learning-to-solve-march-madness/","section":"featured","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Machine learning is the last invention that humanity will need to make\u0026rdquo;.

One of the most important factors lies in the count at the time of the pitch. This makes intuitive sense to any student of the game, and is perhaps seen most clearly in the inordinate size of the strike zone on 3-0 counts, which are often called in the pitchers favor.\nWhile we may wish that umpires were robots who were not influenced by count, score, situation or crowd, the fact that they are human and make slightly biased decisions is part of the romance of the game.\nThe fact that umpire ball/strike decisions can be quantified in such a way as to measure bias is an asset that can be developed in order to make better swing decisions as a batter. We will examine today some of the count influences on calls that may be useful to a batter. We will further discuss some ways these realizations can be used to improve a variety of models.\nIn order to test the question of how count affects umpire calls, I used data found from fangraphs.\nszcountfg\r## # A tibble: 12 x 5\r## Balls Strikes LHSZsize RHSZsize avgszsize\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 0 0 3.4 3.49 3.44\r## 2 0 1 2.75 2.89 2.82\r## 3 0 2 2.38 2.39 2.38\r## 4 1 0 3.43 3.52 3.48\r## 5 1 1 3 3.07 3.04\r## 6 1 2 2.53 2.43 2.48\r## 7 2 0 3.55 3.63 3.59\r## 8 2 1 3.1 3.21 3.16\r## 9 2 2 2.92 2.88 2.9 ## 10 3 0 3.7 3.73 3.72\r## 11 3 1 3.22 3.36 3.29\r## 12 3 2 2.87 2.97 2.92\rRight away, we see sizable differences in the strike zone depending on count.

Not only are pitchers just trying to put the ball over the plate on 3-0, it seems the umpires generally lend a helping hand, granting borderline calls as strikes at much higher rates than in any other count.\nWe can better visualize this relationship by creating a linear model and visualizing this data with a scatterplot.\nlm_model \u0026lt;- linear_reg() %\u0026gt;%\rset_engine(\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\rfit_lm \u0026lt;- lm_model %\u0026gt;%\rfit(avgszsize ~ Balls + Strikes, data = szcountfg)\rtrainresults \u0026lt;- szcountfg %\u0026gt;%\rbind_cols(predict(fit_lm, szcountfg))\rmetrics(trainresults, truth = avgszsize, estimate = .pred)\r## # A tibble: 3 x 3\r## .metric .estimator .estimate\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 rmse standard 0.0746\r## 2 rsq standard 0.966 ## 3 mae standard 0.0576\r## # A tibble: 3 x 7\r## term estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 (Intercept) 3.32 0.0516 64.4 2.66e-13 3.20 3.44 ## 2 Balls 0.149 0.0222 6.71 8.71e- 5 0.0990 0.200\r## 3 Strikes -0.443 0.0305 -14.5 1.49e- 7 -0.511 -0.374\rOur model brings us impressive results on the limited data we have, which is a good sign, though somewhat unimportant with such a small data set. What we really want to see is what this looks like visually.\nLet’s take a look at the relationship between the number of strikes and the strike zone size in square feet.\nggplot() + geom_point(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Strikes, y=avgszsize)) + geom_smooth(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Strikes, y=avgszsize), method=\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, se=FALSE)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rAnd here are the number of balls in the count compared to the zone size.\nggplot() + geom_point(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Balls, y=avgszsize)) + geom_smooth(data=szcountfg, aes(x=Balls, y=avgszsize), method=\u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;, se=FALSE)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rHow might we explain this relationship? A couple things come to mind immediately. A likely possibility is that umpires want to let the outcome be settled on the field, without interfering themselves. This leads to a hesitancy to call a 3rd strike unless it is obvious, and likewise a hesitancy to call ball 4 unless it is obvious.\nWhether you view this as a good thing or a bad thing depends on which side of the decision you find yourself on, I suppose.\nThis relationship has also been observed in other sports using data, though perhaps none know this better than the fans who have watched officials refrain from calling pass interference on the final drive of the game, or basketball refs swallow the whistle on an obvious shooting foul in the final seconds.\nOne obvious application of this fact comes in adjusting models based on expected zone size for the count. For example, a batter may be rated higher in our models for laying off an 0-2 pitch compared to a 1-0 pitch in the same exact spot.\nI will likely look to implement this fact as I develop expected walk and strikeout percentages from last year’s MLB season. Using this information, we can design models which will help us identify players to expect bounceback seasons from, as well as find players we can expect to be overrated.\n","date":1644969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645037503,"objectID":"0173182e90646f8cc7115639201c519c","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/baseball/how-strike-zone-size-differs-based-on-count/","publishdate":"2022-02-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/baseball/how-strike-zone-size-differs-based-on-count/","section":"baseball","summary":"There are a variety of studies which have examined the way situational factors affect ball/strike calls.

Meanwhile, the SPX actually went on a tear compared to its peers. HSI became human again. The majority yielded negative returns after a scorching bull run the previous decade.\nLast decade, from 2010 to 2020, the 399001 index (Shenzen, China) went from best performer to worst.

Thompson, a Junior, comes in with significant starting experience from his time at Texas and will provide the Huskers with much needed maturity at the position.\nOn paper, Thompson was one of the best QB’s in the Big 12 in the 2021 season, completing 165/261 passes for 2113 yards and 24 touchdowns to 9 interceptions. Thompson comes to Nebraska with a near 64% completion rate and 30-9 TD/INT ratio. He finished the season with a QBR of 154.7, good for 26th in the nation.\nHe replaces Nebraska veteran Adrian Martinez, who recently announced a decision to transfer to Kansas State. Martinez, both loved and the object of fierce criticism at times, battled multiple shoulder injuries while at Nebraska. He often started seasons extremely well, only to re-injure his throwing shoulder mid-season. He frequently played through pain and adversity and was a great team leader but struggled in big moments.\nDuring his time at Nebraska, Martinez completed a solid 63.5% of his passes but struggled with a 45-30 TD/INT ratio. Martinez finished his career with a mediocre QBR of 139.5.\nCasey Thompson on Paper\rCasey Thompson did not initially find himself as the starter at Texas this season, coming in to replace Hudson Card against Arkansas. After that, Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian named Thompson the starter for each of the following 7 games.\nThompson started the season very well going 70/97 (72.2%) in his first 4 games as starter, with 13 TD’s to 3 INT’s. In his 4th game as starter against Oklahoma, he suffered a thumb injury on his throwing hand that plagued him for the rest of the season. After the Oklahoma game, the ball came out of his hand noticeably different, and he went just 91/151 (60.2%) with 10 touchdowns to 6 interceptions over the course of the following 6 games. Thompson would only play part of several of those 6 games, sharing time with Card as he struggled at times down the stretch.\nThompson never really looked himself after the thumb injury, with the ball coming out of his hand with noticeably less zip and accuracy. Despite that, he managed to lead the Longhorns to near upsets of Oklahoma State and Baylor. Though Thompson’s Longhorns struggled on the season, posting a 5-7 record, the woes are hard to pin on the Oklahoma City native, who led the Texas offense to 41 points per game on the days when he took the most snaps at QB.\nOn his career, prior to the thumb injury, Thompson was 99/139 (71.2%) with 20 touchdowns to 3 interceptions, posting a jaw dropping QBR of 200.4 in that span. That QBR would have placed him 2nd in the country in 2021, and 1st in 2020. Granted, his numbers are on significantly fewer plays than that of a full time starter, but it provides the best case scenario of what Thompson might be if he finds himself healthy with a full time role in Lincoln this fall.\nAnother ability that Thompson brings to the Huskers is an adeptness at evading pressure. In situations where Thompson had less than 2.5 seconds to get rid of the ball, he led the Big 12 in QBR, passing touchdowns, first downs, and was third in passing yardage. Thompson is a passing QB first, but is athletic enough to do damage with his legs, which he often used to avoid seemingly endless pressure. Texas’s offensive line struggled enormously this season, something which Nebraska fans can relate to. The Huskers are hoping for significant improvement in 2022, with experienced transfers Kevin Williams and Hunter Anthony joining Dominic Raiola’s revamped unit. If and when the offensive line struggles early in the season, Thompson will not be fazed, which is crucial to a successful offense for OC Mark Whipple.\nScouting Thompson on Film\r   On film, one thing that stands out about Thompson is his ability to go through his progressions. Husker fans have grown accustomed to quarterbacks who lock in on a target from before the snap, and Thompson will be a nice change of pace in that regard, quickly diagnosing defenses and throwing to the open man.\nWhen healthy, Thompson showed excellent touch on throws from the pocket, though his deep ball was inconsistent at times. For the fall season, Thompson will want to improve in this area.\nThompson also struggled with passing on the run or on bootlegs, something which Martinez often made look effortless. It will be important for him to throw in the pocket, and the better the offensive line is, the better he will be.\nLastly, Thompson struggled down the stretch and made several costly mistakes, none more costly than a pick-6 against Oklahoma State that likely cost the Longhorns the game. While Thompson was battling a thumb injury that made his throws significantly easier to defend, he will need to learn from mistakes made down the stretch mentally.\nThe Cornhuskers have found an intriguing prospect at QB, and Thompson looks fully set to start in 2022. He joins a QB room with returners Logan Smothers and Heinrich Haarberg, and the Huskers may look to add another QB from the transfer portal. Thompson has the attention of Husker nation going into the fall.

One of the most outstanding storylines to come from the season was Georgia’s defense.\nEntering the SEC title game, Georgia found themselves ranked #1 in points per game allowed among all teams in the 21st century, allowing a meager 6.9 points per game. With stats as absurd as these, many have crowned Georgia the best defense of the 21st century.

Georgia ranks #4 in the stat that matters most. #4 in the 21st century isn’t too shabby.\nBut what if we want to consider more than just points per game? Let’s also evaluate them in terms of the number of yards allowed per play, which I would argue is even more important than points per game.\nTo illustrate why I believe this is the case, consider the difference between a defense facing 80 plays per game against explosive Big 12 offenses, and a Big Ten team which controls time of possession and is accustomed to facing only 50 plays per game. We would expect the Big 12 defense to give up more yards due to pace of play, but this does not necessarily make the Big 10 defense better.\nCase in point: Iowa-Wisconsin, vs. Oklahoma State-Oklahoma. Those games are going to play out completely differently simply based on pace of play.\n# Let\u0026#39;s consider the top 10 defenses by Yards Per Play ypp \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% select(School, Avg)\rhead(arrange(ypp,(Avg)), n = 10)\r## # A tibble: 10 x 2\r## School Avg\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Alabama 3.3\r## 2 North Carolina State 3.5\r## 3 Virginia Tech 3.6\r## 4 Texas Christian 3.6\r## 5 Ohio State 3.6\r## 6 USC 3.6\r## 7 Kansas State 3.7\r## 8 Texas Christian 3.8\r## 9 Southern Mississippi 3.8\r## 10 Texas 3.8\rThis is a good start, but things are starting to get confusing. A lot of these teams didn’t show up in our top 10 defenses by scoring. Georgia doesn’t show up at all.\nTo simplify, let’s make our own ranking of a “great defense”. The components of a good defense are many, but on paper we can make it remarkably simple. How good is their pass defense, rush defense, and do they force turnovers? Most importantly, how many points a game are they giving up?\nWe can take these 4 categories and make a new, composite stat, which combines all 4. In order to do this, we will use a z-score. A z-score is a numeric value, where which compares how much better or worse you are than average teams, and standardizes it, making it perfect for comparison across stats with different scales. We will find the z-score for each of our 4 stats and sum them to get a new composite ranking.\nlogs \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreRushing = -(rAvg - mean(rAvg)/sd(rAvg))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(pAvg = pYds/pAtt) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScorePassing = -(pAvg - mean(pAvg)/sd(pAvg))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreScoring = -(Pts - mean(Pts)/sd(Pts))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreTurnovers = (TO - mean(TO)/sd(TO))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreComposite = (zScorePassing + zScoreRushing + zScoreScoring + zScoreTurnovers))\rtop10 \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% select(School, Year, Pts, pAvg, rAvg, TO, rYds, pYds, zScoreComposite)\rtop10 \u0026lt;- top10 %\u0026gt;% filter(zScoreComposite \u0026gt; -3.52)\rstop10 \u0026lt;- top10 %\u0026gt;% select(School, zScoreComposite)\rhead(arrange(stop10,desc(zScoreComposite)), n = 10)\r## # A tibble: 10 x 2\r## School zScoreComposite\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Alabama -0.0772\r## 2 Miami (FL) -0.274 ## 3 USC -0.710 ## 4 Texas Christian -1.50 ## 5 Florida State -1.98 ## 6 Nebraska -2.95 ## 7 Georgia -2.95 ## 8 LSU -2.96 ## 9 Texas Christian -3.23 ## 10 Kansas State -3.51\rWe find Georgia sitting at a respectable 6th on our new ranking. For perspective, yesterday when I ran these numbers, Georgia came out on top. With the updated numbers, Georgia’s most proximal comparison is the Nebraska defense of 2009 which held Colt McCoy’s #3 Texas to 12 points in the Big 12 championship game, and the LSU defense of 2003.\ngeorgia \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(School == \u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot; \u0026amp; Year == 2021) logs %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() + geom_point(data = logs, aes(x=Yds,y=Pts), color = \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;) + geom_point(data = georgia, aes(x=Yds,y=Pts), color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_smooth(data = logs, method=\u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, aes(x=Yds, y=Pts), formula= y~x) +\rgeom_hline(yintercept=mean(logs$Pts, na.rm = TRUE), color=\u0026quot;dark grey\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept=mean(logs$Yds, na.rm = TRUE), color=\u0026quot;dark grey\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(x=250,y=8, label=\u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot;), color=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Yards per Game Allowed\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Points per Game Allowed\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Despite the Lackluster Performance Yesterday...\u0026quot;, subtitle = \u0026quot;Georgia stacks up among the best in the 21st Century on Defense\u0026quot;, caption = \u0026quot;By: Collin Dougherty | Data Source: sportsreference.com\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;))\rEven though they find themselves slipping a bit in the rankings, and will likely continue to do so as they face the best teams in the country in the playoffs, we can see with a quick visualization just how elite this defense has been this year.

The fact that Oklahoma State held teams to such low yardage seems especially impressive when considering the pace of play in the Big 12 compared to the Big 10 and SEC.\nInterestingly, the #4 and #5 defenses find themselves in the playoffs with Georgia.\nAlternatively, using the composite stat we made earlier, Georgia ranks #1 this year, Cincinnati ranks #2, Michigan comes in at #7 and Alabama trails the pack at #15.\nBegin mentally preparing for a lot of punts in this playoff.

Frost has raised his total losses in one score games to 17 since becoming the coach at Nebraska, with a record of 5-17 in such contests. Husker fans continue to debate whether or not his team is making progress. Any progress that has been made is hidden underneath an ugly 3-5 record, placing the Huskers last in the Big Ten West. But under the surface, a much more optimistic picture does indeed appear.\nMany Nebraska fans have begun to complain louder and louder, and Frost’s seat is growing warmer by the loss. While Athletic Director Trev Alberts has expressed support and indicated that he is pleased with the improvements that have been made, many fans are left asking, “what improvements”? After all, the Huskers have a record of 3-5 as of today, and their best season was arguably Frost’s first.\nEvery season experiences fluke outcomes. Is it possible that Nebraska has just been really unlucky? Cursed, even? That’s the question we set out to answer today. Between calls of “joint possession” and “defensive delay of game”, there is reason to expect the Huskers have been at least a little unlucky.\nUsing data from collegefootballdata.com, I was able to run a simple linear regression which was able to predict 83% of 2019 games accurately in a backwards-looking fashion. For example, given all the games of 2019 and the stats of each game, it was able to correctly predict the outcome of the game, based only on its statistics, 83% of the time. The model is based on 3 factors which were highly predictive and independent: Predicted Points Added, Success Rate, and Explosiveness. I have dubbed this ‘The Triadic Model of College Football’. The three factors which make up the Triadic Model are briefly described here.\nPredicted Points Added: “PPA uses Expected Points to measure the outcome of a play. It takes the EP value from the beginning of a play (e.g. 2nd and 5 at the 50) and subtracts it from the EP value resulting from the play (e.g. rush for 10 yards results in 1st and 10 from the 40).” [Credit.]\nSuccess Rate: The success rate of a play is well defined in college football analytics circles. A successful play counts as any of the following:\r- Gaining 50% of the yardage to go on 1st down\r- Gaining 70% of the yardage to go on 2nd down\r- Gaining 100% of the yardage to go on 3rd down\rThe success rate is thus the number of successful plays divided by the sum of all plays.\nExplosiveness: “Explosiveness measures the average EPA on plays which were marked as successful. It uses this site’s EPA implementation (known as PPA).” [Credit.]\nIn sum, these three factors are all positively correlated with winning. More successful plays, explosiveness, and predicted points added all correlate to more points scored. The inverse applies for defenses. When running the Triadic Model, we can not only predict wins and losses, but even specific scores, with a high degree of accuracy. The Triadic Model is simple, it excludes garbage time (Garbage Time occurs when one of the following scenarios is met: Scoring margin is 38+ points in the 2nd quarter, 28+ points in the 3rd quarter, or 22+ points in the 4th quarter), and it doesn’t factor in turnovers or special teams, which are demonstrably key aspects of winning. But, sometimes simple models are just as good, and an 83% accuracy rating seems to point in this direction.\nAt some point in the future, I hope to incorporate turnover and special teams stats, which should help increase accuracy even more. It would also be worthwhile to consider garbage time stats, as a backwards-looking model is only interested in what actually happened. The model without garbage time stats should come in handy later on, when looking to predict how a team will do in future games. By way of example, the current model is known to underestimate scoring margins in blowouts because of the exclusion of garbage time stats.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into what the Triadic Model has to say about the Huskers 2021 season.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial,

23\rMichigan\r29 - 32\r30 - 29\rMichigan State\r20 - 23\r30 - 21\rMinnesota\r23 - 30\r26 - 30\rBuffalo\r28 - 3\r39 - 18\rOklahoma\r16 - 23\r28 - 42\rNorthwestern\r56 - 7\r60 - 28\rFordham\r52 - 7\r35 - 33\r\r\rBy: Collin Dougherty\r\r\r\r\rPerhaps unsurprisingly, the model indicates Nebraska has indeed underperformed. What may come as a surprise to many, however, is the margin by which that underperformance has come. Our model predicts a 6-2 record for the Cornhuskers. Given the strength of schedule faced to date (TeamRankings currently says it ranks 13th in difficulty, FPI currently ranks it 5th), the Huskers have played remarkably well. With a 6-2 record, a top 15 rating would likely follow. And yet the Huskers receive no votes for the top 25, sitting instead at a lowly 3-5, last in the Big Ten West.\nThe model predicts a nail-biting win against Michigan, a blowout win over Illinois, and a comfortable win against Michigan State on the road. It also feels confident the Huskers laid an egg against Minnesota, with a predicted loss on the road, and suggests maybe the Huskers were lucky to keep Oklahoma within one score based on how they played.\nLet’s visualize the Huskers season further. Instead of looking at total yardage gained and allowed, we will look at yards per play and yards per play allowed. These stats help take into account pace of play and provide a more accurate picture of how a team is playing.\nNebraska, perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, finds itself among the better teams in college football when looking at YPP. But zooming in, we may be surprised at just how good their company is.\nThe Huskers nearest comparisons in YPP? #1. Georgia(7-0), #4. Ohio State(6-1), #2. Cincinnati(7-0), #3 Alabama(7-0), #8. Michigan State(7-0), #16 Baylor(6-1), #22. Iowa State(5-2), and only one unranked team, Florida(4-3), yes, the same Florida that took Alabama to the wire.\nLooking even deeper, we see that not only has Nebraska badly underperformed, it is in fact one of only 3 teams to do so at such a dramatic clip this season, joining the ranks of Florida State and Western Kentucky.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',

Yes, even Ohio State has underperformed at 6-1, with the model suggesting they deserved to win against Oregon. The Huskers will face stiff tests these next four games. More optimistically, the numbers suggest they should be able to hang with all of them.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell,

Frost has raised his total losses in one score games to 17 since becoming the coach at Nebraska, with a record of 5-17 in such contests. Husker fans continue to debate whether or not his team is making progress. Any progress that has been made is hidden underneath an ugly 3-5 record, placing the Huskers last in the Big Ten West. But under the surface, a much more optimistic picture does indeed appear.\nMany Nebraska fans have begun to complain louder and louder, and Frost’s seat is growing warmer by the loss. While Athletic Director Trev Alberts has expressed support and indicated that he is pleased with the improvements that have been made, many fans are left asking, “what improvements”? After all, the Huskers have a record of 3-5 as of today, and their best season was arguably Frost’s first.\nEvery season experiences fluke outcomes. Is it possible that Nebraska has just been really unlucky? Cursed, even? That’s the question we set out to answer today. Between calls of “joint possession” and “defensive delay of game”, there is reason to expect the Huskers have been at least a little unlucky.\nUsing data from collegefootballdata.com, I was able to run a simple linear regression which was able to predict 83% of 2019 games accurately in a backwards-looking fashion. For example, given all the games of 2019 and the stats of each game, it was able to correctly predict the outcome of the game, based only on its statistics, 83% of the time. The model is based on 3 factors which were highly predictive and independent: Predicted Points Added, Success Rate, and Explosiveness. I have dubbed this ‘The Triadic Model of College Football’. The three factors which make up the Triadic Model are briefly described here.\nPredicted Points Added: “PPA uses Expected Points to measure the outcome of a play. It takes the EP value from the beginning of a play (e.g. 2nd and 5 at the 50) and subtracts it from the EP value resulting from the play (e.g. rush for 10 yards results in 1st and 10 from the 40).” [Credit.]\nSuccess Rate: The success rate of a play is well defined in college football analytics circles. A successful play counts as any of the following:\r- Gaining 50% of the yardage to go on 1st down\r- Gaining 70% of the yardage to go on 2nd down\r- Gaining 100% of the yardage to go on 3rd down\rThe success rate is thus the number of successful plays divided by the sum of all plays.\nExplosiveness: “Explosiveness measures the average EPA on plays which were marked as successful. It uses this site’s EPA implementation (known as PPA).” [Credit.]\nIn sum, these three factors are all positively correlated with winning. More successful plays, explosiveness, and predicted points added all correlate to more points scored. The inverse applies for defenses. When running the Triadic Model, we can not only predict wins and losses, but even specific scores, with a high degree of accuracy. The Triadic Model is simple, it excludes garbage time (Garbage Time occurs when one of the following scenarios is met: Scoring margin is 38+ points in the 2nd quarter, 28+ points in the 3rd quarter, or 22+ points in the 4th quarter), and it doesn’t factor in turnovers or special teams, which are demonstrably key aspects of winning. But, sometimes simple models are just as good, and an 83% accuracy rating seems to point in this direction.\nAt some point in the future, I hope to incorporate turnover and special teams stats, which should help increase accuracy even more. It would also be worthwhile to consider garbage time stats, as a backwards-looking model is only interested in what actually happened. The model without garbage time stats should come in handy later on, when looking to predict how a team will do in future games. By way of example, the current model is known to underestimate scoring margins in blowouts because of the exclusion of garbage time stats.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into what the Triadic Model has to say about the Huskers 2021 season.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial,

23\rMichigan\r29 - 32\r30 - 29\rMichigan State\r20 - 23\r30 - 21\rMinnesota\r23 - 30\r26 - 30\rBuffalo\r28 - 3\r39 - 18\rOklahoma\r16 - 23\r28 - 42\rNorthwestern\r56 - 7\r60 - 28\rFordham\r52 - 7\r35 - 33\r\r\rBy: Collin Dougherty\r\r\r\r\rPerhaps unsurprisingly, the model indicates Nebraska has indeed underperformed. What may come as a surprise to many, however, is the margin by which that underperformance has come. Our model predicts a 6-2 record for the Cornhuskers. Given the strength of schedule faced to date (TeamRankings currently says it ranks 13th in difficulty, FPI currently ranks it 5th), the Huskers have played remarkably well. With a 6-2 record, a top 15 rating would likely follow. And yet the Huskers receive no votes for the top 25, sitting instead at a lowly 3-5, last in the Big Ten West.\nThe model predicts a nail-biting win against Michigan, a blowout win over Illinois, and a comfortable win against Michigan State on the road. It also feels confident the Huskers laid an egg against Minnesota, with a predicted loss on the road, and suggests maybe the Huskers were lucky to keep Oklahoma within one score based on how they played.\nLet’s visualize the Huskers season further. Instead of looking at total yardage gained and allowed, we will look at yards per play and yards per play allowed. These stats help take into account pace of play and provide a more accurate picture of how a team is playing.\nNebraska, perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, finds itself among the better teams in college football when looking at YPP. But zooming in, we may be surprised at just how good their company is.\nThe Huskers nearest comparisons in YPP? #1. Georgia(7-0), #4. Ohio State(6-1), #2. Cincinnati(7-0), #3 Alabama(7-0), #8. Michigan State(7-0), #16 Baylor(6-1), #22. Iowa State(5-2), and only one unranked team, Florida(4-3), yes, the same Florida that took Alabama to the wire.\nLooking even deeper, we see that not only has Nebraska badly underperformed, it is in fact one of only 3 teams to do so at such a dramatic clip this season, joining the ranks of Florida State and Western Kentucky.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',
