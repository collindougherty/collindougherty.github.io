One of the most outstanding storylines to come from the season was Georgia’s defense.\nEntering the SEC title game, Georgia found themselves ranked #1 in points per game allowed among all teams in the 21st century, allowing a meager 6.9 points per game. With stats as absurd as these, many have crowned Georgia the best defense of the 21st century. Yesterday’s 41-24 drubbing at the hands of Alabama has tarnished their stats some, but they still find themselves among the very best.

Georgia ranks #4 in the stat that matters most. #4 in the 21st century isn’t too shabby.\nBut what if we want to consider more than just points per game? Let’s also evaluate them in terms of the number of yards allowed per play, which I would argue is even more important than points per game.\nTo illustrate why I believe this is the case, consider the difference between a defense facing 80 plays per game against explosive Big 12 offenses, and a Big Ten team which controls time of possession and is accustomed to facing only 50 plays per game. We would expect the Big 12 defense to give up more yards due to pace of play, but this does not necessarily make the Big 10 defense better.\nCase in point: Iowa-Wisconsin, vs. Oklahoma State-Oklahoma. Those games are going to play out completely differently simply based on pace of play.\n# Let\u0026#39;s consider the top 10 defenses by Yards Per Play ypp \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% select(School, Avg)\rhead(arrange(ypp,(Avg)), n = 10)\r## # A tibble: 10 x 2\r## School Avg\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Alabama 3.3\r## 2 North Carolina State 3.5\r## 3 Virginia Tech 3.6\r## 4 Texas Christian 3.6\r## 5 Ohio State 3.6\r## 6 USC 3.6\r## 7 Kansas State 3.7\r## 8 Texas Christian 3.8\r## 9 Southern Mississippi 3.8\r## 10 Texas 3.8\rThis is a good start, but things are starting to get confusing. A lot of these teams didn’t show up in our top 10 defenses by scoring. Georgia doesn’t show up at all.\nTo simplify, let’s make our own ranking of a “great defense”. The components of a good defense are many, but on paper we can make it remarkably simple. How good is their pass defense, rush defense, and do they force turnovers? Most importantly, how many points a game are they giving up?\nWe can take these 4 categories and make a new, composite stat, which combines all 4. In order to do this, we will use a z-score. A z-score is a numeric value, where which compares how much better or worse you are than average teams, and standardizes it, making it perfect for comparison across stats with different scales. We will find the z-score for each of our 4 stats and sum them to get a new composite ranking.\nlogs \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreRushing = -(rAvg - mean(rAvg)/sd(rAvg))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(pAvg = pYds/pAtt) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScorePassing = -(pAvg - mean(pAvg)/sd(pAvg))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreScoring = -(Pts - mean(Pts)/sd(Pts))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreTurnovers = (TO - mean(TO)/sd(TO))) %\u0026gt;% mutate(zScoreComposite = (zScorePassing + zScoreRushing + zScoreScoring + zScoreTurnovers))\rtop10 \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;% select(School, Year, Pts, pAvg, rAvg, TO, rYds, pYds, zScoreComposite)\rtop10 \u0026lt;- top10 %\u0026gt;% filter(zScoreComposite \u0026gt; -3.52)\rstop10 \u0026lt;- top10 %\u0026gt;% select(School, zScoreComposite)\rhead(arrange(stop10,desc(zScoreComposite)), n = 10)\r## # A tibble: 10 x 2\r## School zScoreComposite\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 Alabama -0.0772\r## 2 Miami (FL) -0.274 ## 3 USC -0.710 ## 4 Texas Christian -1.50 ## 5 Florida State -1.98 ## 6 Nebraska -2.95 ## 7 Georgia -2.95 ## 8 LSU -2.96 ## 9 Texas Christian -3.23 ## 10 Kansas State -3.51\rWe find Georgia sitting at a respectable 6th on our new ranking. For perspective, yesterday when I ran these numbers, Georgia came out on top. With the updated numbers, Georgia’s most proximal comparison is the Nebraska defense of 2009 which held Colt McCoy’s #3 Texas to 12 points in the Big 12 championship game, and the LSU defense of 2003.\ngeorgia \u0026lt;- logs %\u0026gt;%\rfilter(School == \u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot; \u0026amp; Year == 2021) logs %\u0026gt;%\rggplot() + geom_point(data = logs, aes(x=Yds,y=Pts), color = \u0026quot;grey\u0026quot;) + geom_point(data = georgia, aes(x=Yds,y=Pts), color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_smooth(data = logs, method=\u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;, aes(x=Yds, y=Pts), formula= y~x) +\rgeom_hline(yintercept=mean(logs$Pts, na.rm = TRUE), color=\u0026quot;dark grey\u0026quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept=mean(logs$Yds, na.rm = TRUE), color=\u0026quot;dark grey\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(x=250,y=8, label=\u0026quot;Georgia\u0026quot;), color=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;Yards per Game Allowed\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Points per Game Allowed\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Despite the Lackluster Performance Yesterday...\u0026quot;, subtitle = \u0026quot;Georgia stacks up among the best in the 21st Century on Defense\u0026quot;, caption = \u0026quot;By: Collin Dougherty | Data Source: sportsreference.com\u0026quot;) + theme_minimal() +\rtheme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \u0026quot;bold\u0026quot;))\rEven though they find themselves slipping a bit in the rankings, and will likely continue to do so as they face the best teams in the country in the playoffs, we can see with a quick visualization just how elite this defense has been this year.

We have passing yards per game allowed in red and rushing yards per game allowed in blue. Overall, Georgia comes in just behind Wisconsin for best defenses on a yards per game scale, and just ahead of Oklahoma State. The fact that Oklahoma State held teams to such low yardage seems especially impressive when considering the pace of play in the Big 12 compared to the Big 10 and SEC.\nInterestingly, the #4 and #5 defenses find themselves in the playoffs with Georgia.\nAlternatively, using the composite stat we made earlier, Georgia ranks #1 this year, Cincinnati ranks #2, Michigan comes in at #7 and Alabama trails the pack at #15.\nBegin mentally preparing for a lot of punts in this playoff.

Frost has raised his total losses in one score games to 17 since becoming the coach at Nebraska, with a record of 5-17 in such contests. Husker fans continue to debate whether or not his team is making progress. Any progress that has been made is hidden underneath an ugly 3-5 record, placing the Huskers last in the Big Ten West. But under the surface, a much more optimistic picture does indeed appear.\nMany Nebraska fans have begun to complain louder and louder, and Frost’s seat is growing warmer by the loss. While Athletic Director Trev Alberts has expressed support and indicated that he is pleased with the improvements that have been made, many fans are left asking, “what improvements”? After all, the Huskers have a record of 3-5 as of today, and their best season was arguably Frost’s first.\nEvery season experiences fluke outcomes. Is it possible that Nebraska has just been really unlucky? Cursed, even? That’s the question we set out to answer today. Between calls of “joint possession” and “defensive delay of game”, there is reason to expect the Huskers have been at least a little unlucky.\nUsing data from collegefootballdata.com, I was able to run a simple linear regression which was able to predict 83% of 2019 games accurately in a backwards-looking fashion. For example, given all the games of 2019 and the stats of each game, it was able to correctly predict the outcome of the game, based only on its statistics, 83% of the time. The model is based on 3 factors which were highly predictive and independent: Predicted Points Added, Success Rate, and Explosiveness. I have dubbed this ‘The Triadic Model of College Football’. The three factors which make up the Triadic Model are briefly described here.\nPredicted Points Added: “PPA uses Expected Points to measure the outcome of a play. It takes the EP value from the beginning of a play (e.g. 2nd and 5 at the 50) and subtracts it from the EP value resulting from the play (e.g. rush for 10 yards results in 1st and 10 from the 40).” [Credit.]\nSuccess Rate: The success rate of a play is well defined in college football analytics circles. A successful play counts as any of the following:\r- Gaining 50% of the yardage to go on 1st down\r- Gaining 70% of the yardage to go on 2nd down\r- Gaining 100% of the yardage to go on 3rd down\rThe success rate is thus the number of successful plays divided by the sum of all plays.\nExplosiveness: “Explosiveness measures the average EPA on plays which were marked as successful. It uses this site’s EPA implementation (known as PPA).” [Credit.]\nIn sum, these three factors are all positively correlated with winning. More successful plays, explosiveness, and predicted points added all correlate to more points scored. The inverse applies for defenses. When running the Triadic Model, we can not only predict wins and losses, but even specific scores, with a high degree of accuracy. The Triadic Model is simple, it excludes garbage time (Garbage Time occurs when one of the following scenarios is met: Scoring margin is 38+ points in the 2nd quarter, 28+ points in the 3rd quarter, or 22+ points in the 4th quarter), and it doesn’t factor in turnovers or special teams, which are demonstrably key aspects of winning. But, sometimes simple models are just as good, and an 83% accuracy rating seems to point in this direction.\nAt some point in the future, I hope to incorporate turnover and special teams stats, which should help increase accuracy even more. It would also be worthwhile to consider garbage time stats, as a backwards-looking model is only interested in what actually happened. The model without garbage time stats should come in handy later on, when looking to predict how a team will do in future games. By way of example, the current model is known to underestimate scoring margins in blowouts because of the exclusion of garbage time stats.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into what the Triadic Model has to say about the Huskers 2021 season.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial,

- 33\r\r\rBy: Collin Dougherty\r\r\r\r\rPerhaps unsurprisingly, the model indicates Nebraska has indeed underperformed. What may come as a surprise to many, however, is the margin by which that underperformance has come. Our model predicts a 6-2 record for the Cornhuskers. Given the strength of schedule faced to date (TeamRankings currently says it ranks 13th in difficulty, FPI currently ranks it 5th), the Huskers have played remarkably well. With a 6-2 record, a top 15 rating would likely follow. And yet the Huskers receive no votes for the top 25, sitting instead at a lowly 3-5, last in the Big Ten West.\nThe model predicts a nail-biting win against Michigan, a blowout win over Illinois, and a comfortable win against Michigan State on the road. It also feels confident the Huskers laid an egg against Minnesota, with a predicted loss on the road, and suggests maybe the Huskers were lucky to keep Oklahoma within one score based on how they played.\nLet’s visualize the Huskers season further. Instead of looking at total yardage gained and allowed, we will look at yards per play and yards per play allowed. These stats help take into account pace of play and provide a more accurate picture of how a team is playing.\nNebraska, perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, finds itself among the better teams in college football when looking at YPP. But zooming in, we may be surprised at just how good their company is.\nThe Huskers nearest comparisons in YPP? #1. Georgia(7-0), #4. Ohio State(6-1), #2. Cincinnati(7-0), #3 Alabama(7-0), #8. Michigan State(7-0), #16 Baylor(6-1), #22. Iowa State(5-2), and only one unranked team, Florida(4-3), yes, the same Florida that took Alabama to the wire.\nLooking even deeper, we see that not only has Nebraska badly underperformed, it is in fact one of only 3 teams to do so at such a dramatic clip this season, joining the ranks of Florida State and Western Kentucky.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',

Yes, even Ohio State has underperformed at 6-1, with the model suggesting they deserved to win against Oregon. The Huskers will face stiff tests these next four games. More optimistically, the numbers suggest they should be able to hang with all of them.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell,

The answer is a resounding yes. There are many reasons to buy Bitcoin. I hope to lay out some of my favorite reasons at some point in the future.\nFor now, I am starting a new journey of my own, dabbling a bit into trading. I won’t be using a significant amount of capital, as I hope to learn on the fly. For most people, trading is unnecessary. Buying and holding will do. I am a hodler at heart myself. But in the interest of learning more about what drives short term price action and my desire to try my hand at day trading have led me to this point.\nI plan to update this post regularly with my trades and a brief explanation of why I am predicting a given short term price action. I may also post some of my options trading. In the interests of privacy and also because I am primarily trading a small amount at first, I will scale everything to a hypothetical initial investment of $10,000 USD. As I go, I hope to learn new things and devise new methods that will help better predict price action.\nThanks for joining me. I hope my insights prove useful.\n10/31/2021: The last week has been mostly uneventful as Bitcoin price has moved mostly sideways within a tight range and altcoins have gone crazy. Shiba Inu, Doge, and others have pumped to absurd new heights before getting recked just as quickly. Let’s dive into some Bitcoin analysis.\nWe have two main patterns emerging: one bullish and one bearish with clear price target invalidations of each. This sets us up for a prime trading opportunity. We’ll dive first into the bull flag that is developing.\nWe have a textbook example of a bull flag forming. For those who are unfamiliar, a bull flag is typically spotted amidst strong upward price action, followed by a period of consolidation. This shows conviction of buyers as the price drops, but is unable to fall significantly below the new prices. Eventually, the price breaks out of its upper resistance levels and goes on to make new highs. Bitcoin shows classic signs of having just broken out of its previous resistance, coming back to test the top of its previous resistance around 60k, where it promptly bounced back to higher levels. The next resistance is around 62.8-64k. After that is clear skies and price discovery. But there is another angle to consider to have a full picture of the current market.\nLooking at the chart above, we see some hints of a head and shoulders pattern, typically signaling a bearish reversal. A head and shoulders pattern is indicated by a local peak, followed by a decline in prices before a new high. After this, there is a period of price decline before bulls make one last push, but they ultimately are stopped short of new highs, indicating a bearish reversal in market sentiment. We would be amiss to not acknowledge these potential signs of a reversal. As can be seen from the chart, 58k-60k remains an area of support, but losing this would indicate validation of the head and shoulders pattern.\nHow I’m playing this for now: a break below 58k would be a clear indicator to sell. I remain convinced we are in the midst of a bull market, and support would likely be found at the 52k level. I would look to re-enter the market there.\nA break above 64k, however, would be a clear validation of the bullish flag signal, and a sign to hold, or re-enter the market if you’ve been sidelined by recent moves. A break of 64k and I’m targeting the 85k region by mid-November, before the next consolidation.\nMy guess, given the current market dynamics, is that we see a bullish continuation in the coming days. But it’s good to always have an exit strategy prepared.\n10/25/2021: I began the process of trading today, sending my initial investment to Kraken. Again, I will be tracking a hypothetical investment of $10,000, based on the returns on my trades. So from this point forward, I will refer to my account balance with respect to the hypothetical $10,000 initial capital, as is standard.\nWe had some interesting price action this morning. While my funds were not transferred in time to sell, we saw a spike in MACD and overbought levels on the RSI. I’ll bide my time in the meantime. Short term price action looks generally positive. We had a strong retest of the EMA (the exponential moving average, seen as the blue line below), and have since bounced well short term.\nI will be watching for the next sell signal, though I will not be surprised if we see continued positive price momentum over the near term, and I remain highly bullish on the current state of the market, fully expecting all time highs in the near future.\nCurrent Account: $10,000 (+0.00%)\n*I am not a financial advisor and the above does not constitute financial advice.
