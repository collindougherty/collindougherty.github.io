Rather, I have noticed an increasing trend among my peers of complaining about the large amount of time they spend on their phones, and, having spent quite a bit of time thinking about these issues myself, felt compelled to share some things that have worked for me. I find that the comments from friends are generally at the point of resignation, and it’s challenging to present ideas in a way that don’t come across as self-congratulatory. Nonetheless, the changes I have made have made a profound impact on me for the better and I desire for others to have the same opportunity if they so desire.\nThe Problem I don’t think most people need to be given a rationale for why they should spend less time on screens, but I will touch on a few thoughts I have that may be novel to folks.\nOne problem I see with screens is closely linked to dopamine. As I touched on in a previous post, by interspersing high dopamine activities like social media throughout the day, we sabotage our ability to appreciate smaller pleasures like reading a book or chatting with a friend.\nAnother huge problem is the ease with which screens enable boredom avoidance. Humans fundamentally hate boredom - even more than expending effort - and many useful creations in the world have come about from people who were bored and decided to do something interesting to alleviate it. Boredom avoidance itself is not the problem, but how we direct our energy is, and screens enable us to turn off boredom instantaneously and without effort, hijacking our dopaminergic pathways and our willingness to expend effort to attain rewards. Worst of all, screens prevent us from going to more constructive activities like reading a book, working on a hobby, or any number of things on that list of ideas we tell ourselves we will do “someday”.\nBut I don’t think most people need convincing that screens are generally a problem, and there are many arguments for this that have been documented in popular media. Our problem is that we feel helpless to do anything to change. Thus, I’ll lay out a few things that have worked for me. Everyone is different, and you have to buy in to your own system for it to be effective, but hopefully this can generate some ideas.\n Solutions Turn your phone into a productivity device, not a distraction device  If you’re like me and most people, your phone is the biggest distraction problem. It’s simply the most accessible. Plus, those apps look so much better on mobile than desktop.\nFacebook found years ago that something like 90% of their user minutes were coming on mobile, and that’s where big tech focuses their attention engineering efforts (which, incidentally is why browser versions suck).\nOne implication of this is that controlling your phone gets you 90% of the way to distraction freedom. Removing the distractions from your phone is a modern analogy for not keeping dessert in the house when you’re trying to cut down on sweets.\nFor me this means deleting every social media, YouTube, and even limiting safari to a limited number of minutes a day (for when I’m really desperate to look up something on the go). I think that’s a pretty good start, but I would also strongly suggest removing any app that isn’t strictly necessary for day to day existence. This is a bit more extreme and can be a longer term goal, but I find that once you’ve removed the big distractions, removing some smaller ones is a logical next step. For me I’m essentially down to phone, messages, chatGPT, a couple productivity apps and a handful of built in apple apps.\nMany people of course have tried this, I’m far from the first to suggest it, but I think building in failsafes for your future self’s inevitable moments of weakness is the key to long term success.\nOne failsafe I’d recommend is getting a friend or family member to set a screen time password for you on the apps that are particularly problematic before you delete them. I have limits on instagram, X, etc, even though they are deleted from my phone, and my sister has the password. This makes it quite an effort to open these apps (for longer than your limit), even if I were to redownload them. I’d recommend setting the limit to something like 1 minute a day, or else consider something like Freedom for more flexibility.\nIf these measures still fail, I recommend blocking the app store (so that you can’t redownload distractions) for certain hours of the day using Freedom, which is my next recommendation.\nGet an app \u0026amp; browser extension like Freedom  Getting your phone under control is only step 1, however. If you’re like me, you’ll soon find that even poorly engineered browser based social media is still quite addictive, and you’ll likely desire to put up guardrails for your PC based browsing.\nPersonally, I love Freedom for this task. It allows you to block sites and apps that you choose, and offers a locked mode which, once active, prevents even you from opening those distractions.\nI find that, while drastic and often annoying, I’d much rather be short term misaligned with my desires, and long term aligned, than the other way around. Eventually, you’ll stop even trying to open the sites that used to steal days from your existence.\nI’ve found particular success in having the schedule start relatively early in the morning, and it being active 6 days out of the week. This enables me to access any distractions I need, but forces me to either wait until my free day on Saturday (which I set to have no blocking) or else to wake up a bit earlier than I’d prefer. Almost all days I’d rather get an extra hour of sleep than scroll social media, so I just end up not on it at all, which I consider a win.\nThat said, it took me about a month to get down this system, and I’d recommend being conservative with what you block in locked mode at first. It’s always easier to add more to your block list than to have to wait 24 hours for something you shouldn’t have blocked in the first place.\nFind your weak points and enact backup measures  I personally found that I was surprisingly good at finding loopholes that enable me to get around my own system (which is hilarious btw), so I’ve had to do a lot of plotting in my wiser moments to prevent myself from doing what I feel like in my dumber moments.\nThings like having the App Store blocked for most of the day on my phone, having someone else with the screen time password, and using blocking software have been hugely effective.\n Conclusions Hopefully, these ideas, rather than giving you a system to copy and paste, have helped you think logically about how to change your tech use for the better.\nFor my part, as constricting as this all sounds, I have come to enjoy it, and on Saturday’s without any of these measures often become quickly overwhelmed by the distractions and crave the simpler existence of Sunday-Friday.\nOn those days, I often get bored. Boredom turns out to be a much more common feeling than I’m used to, but its inspired me to do bigger things, from reading well known literature, to gaining knowledge in fields that interest me and overall having more freedom to follow my curiosity than ever before. Simply knowing that you’ve managed to gain 4-6 hours a day enables you to relax and follow your passions, which often lead to cool and useful things anyways. Successful change with tech has also given me momentum to eat healthier and think logically about behavior change more broadly.\nThe past few months I’ve seen my screen time on my phone drop to under an hour most days (usually just iMessages), I’ve stopped streaming tv shows (except on Saturdays), have had significantly more focus on work and find my mind wandering to interesting new topics and ideas instead of reaching for my phone impulsively. In fact, this very blog post arises from an environment without distractions. 6 months ago I would’ve been watching a tv show or scrolling twitter instead of writing. In short, my life has radically changed for the better within only a few months, and the compounding effects I suspect will be even more substantial.\nObviously, these changes aren’t for everyone, and I have no judgement for that. I only hope that people can live in alignment with what they aspire to, and if these tools help others with similar goals to mine, then that’s more than worth it.\n ","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701412399,"objectID":"67db286e2f8795977af053aeaf3610f1","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/tech-freedom/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/tech-freedom/","section":"featured","summary":"The title of this post sounds rather self-congratulatory, but that’s not really my aim here.

Maslow..? Maslow..?","type":"featured"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Psychology"],"content":" “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” -Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations\nFollow the incentives.\nWhen Captain John Smith and the Virginia Company settled Jamestown in 1607, they were not primarily a band of farmers, hunters, and explorers. Most were upper class adventurers with no experience in procuring their own survival. The first winter in the New World was a brutal lesson for them all in human psychology and motivation. Because the food supply was communal - everyone was guaranteed a meal - few planted, hunted or did any of the requisites for survival away from the luxuries of civilization.\nTwo-thirds of the 120 men died that winter.\nFollowing this, Smith instituted a famous rule: “he who will not work will not eat.”\n85% of the men survived the following winter.\nSuch is a lesson in the power of negative punishment. But there is an equally important lesson in positive reinforcement from colonial times.\nStruggling to turn a profit for the holders of their joint-stock company, the Virginia Company turned to tobacco, a product of the new world, and instituted a policy supported by the Crown which granted 100 acres of land to any freeman who would settle in Virginia. On account of this incentive, thousands flocked to the new world, making themselves and their investors exceedingly wealthy, and ensuring the survival of the colony.\nHumans follow incentives.\nLet’s turn our attention to the incentives of scientific research.\nCollege students go to graduate school, often because they don’t know what to do with their degree in the real world of producing goods and services. Or perhaps to make some more money on account of specific knowledge they can acquire with higher education. Or because they have invested so much time in schooling already that they can’t think beyond the next test and degree.\nIn order to graduate this institution of higher education, you are generally expected to submit a work of research - a thesis. After a life of simply regurgitating knowledge someone else taught them, students have no clue how to do anything truly new. So they do something slightly different from what everyone else in their field is doing. This reasoning by analogy leads to a culture of incrementalism that pervades scientific research from graduate school to tenure.\nThere are many incentives for this behavior. The number of publications to your name are tantamount. But doing something truly new is a risky business. You can spend years working on new ideas that never become worthy of publication. Funding is also harder to acquire. Even more so without a track record of doing novel research. So you get a pareto distribution of production while the vast majority of scientists produce only incremental research that adds little value to human knowledge.\nBeyond this, the incentives are stacked towards publication in a journal that only a tiny percentage of the population is allowed to read. Journals are incentivized to make money, which they do from subscriptions that only universities can afford. Scientists, in order to have their work considered prestigious, rely not on actual substantive zero-to-one step changes in knowledge, but rather acceptance by a high enough quality journal. This enables justification of tenure, funding, promotion, industry connections, social status, or whatever motive is top of mind at the moment.\nTo say nothing of the increasing trend towards misapplication of the precautionary principle in all areas of society, not just research.\nI should add that I think most of the scientific community sees these problems, which is tremendously encouraging. I also have tremendous respect and excitement for the open science movement, although there are certainly still some problems to figure out. But the problems are fundamentally one of incentives. Solve the incentive problem and you solve all the other problems.\nThe incentives as they stand clearly do not align with maximizing human flourishing through scientific advancement.\nWithout scientific advancement there can be no technological advancement.\nWithout technological advancement there can be no economic advancement.\nWithout economic advancement, there can be no positive-sum games.\nWithout positive-sum games there can be no liberty.\n","date":1700524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700548399,"objectID":"16a6b4257c5f9f88188f7cefb44f6823","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/incentives-of-academia/","publishdate":"2023-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/incentives-of-academia/","section":"featured","summary":"“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” -Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations","tags":["Psychology","Research","History"],"title":"The Incentives of Academia are Broken","type":"featured"},{"authors":["Juan A Santamaria-Barria","Hannah Nelson","Heng Jiang","Collin Dougherty","Snehal Jadhav","Shinobu Watanabe-Galloway","Joshua M V Mammen","David W Mercer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686700800,"objectID":"e815af23aa41fcbcc2861d90277c5701","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/opd-payments/","publishdate":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/opd-payments/","section":"publication","summary":"*Objective:* To characterize industry non-research payments made to general and fellowship-trained surgeons between 2016-2020. *Background:* The Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services Open Payments Data (OPD) reports industry payments made to physicians related to drugs and medical devices. General payments are those not associated with research. *Methods:* OPD data were queried for general and fellowship-trained surgeons who received general payments from 2016 to 2020. Payments' nature, amount, company, covered product, and location were collected. Surgeons' demographics, subspecialty, and leadership roles in hospitals, societies, and editorial boards were evaluated. *Results:* From 2016 to 2020, 44,700 general and fellowship-trained surgeons were paid $535,425,543 in 1,440,850 general payments. The median payment was $29.18. The most frequent payments were for food and beverage (76.6%) and travel and lodging (15.6%); however, the highest dollar payments were for consulting fees ($93,128,401; 17.4%), education ($88,404,531; 16.5%), royalty or license ($87,471,238; 16.3%), and travel and lodging ($66,333,149; 12.4%). Five companies made half of all payments ($265,654,522; 49.6%): Intuitive Surgical ($128,517,411; 24%), Boston Scientific ($48,094,570; 9%), Edwards Lifesciences ($41,835,544, 7.8%), Medtronic Vascular ($33,607,136; 6.3%), and W. L. Gore \u0026 Associates ($16,626,371; 3.1%). Medical devices comprised 74.7% of payments ($399,897,217), followed by drugs and biologicals ($33,945,300; 6.3%). TX, CA, FL, NY, and PA received the most payments; however, the top dollar payments were in CA ($65,702,579; 12.3%), MI ($52,990,904, 9.9%), TX ($39,362,131; 7.4%), MD ($37,611,959; 7%), and FL ($33,417,093, 6.2%). General surgery received the highest total payments ($245,031,174; 45.8%), followed by thoracic surgery ($167,806,514; 31.3%) and vascular surgery ($60,781,266; 11.4%). A total of 10,361 surgeons were paid $5,000, of which 1,614 were women (15.6%); in this group, men received higher payments than women (means, $53,446 vs. $22,571; P$500,000 ($203,011,672; 38%) - 5 non-Hispanic white (NHW) women (4.2%) and 82 NHW (68.3%), 24 Asian (20%), 7 Hispanic (5.8%), and 2 Black (1.7%) men; in this group, men received higher payments than women (means, $1,735,570 vs. $684,224), and NHW men received payments double those of other men (means, $2,049,554 vs. $955,368; NS, P=0.087). Among these 120 highly paid surgeons ($500,000), 55 held hospital and departmental leadership roles, 30 were leaders in surgical societies, 27 authored clinical guidelines, and 16 served on journal editorial boards. During COVID-19, 2020 experienced half the number of payments than the preceding 3 years. *Conclusions:* General and fellowship-trained surgeons received substantial industry non-research payments.

I was born the year before the dot com bubble burst. I remember my parents talking about the Great Recession. Family friends were unemployed, and I was too young to understand why. My generation has no firsthand experience with life changing economic events.\nThat all changes this year.\nThe Housing Bubble\rMichael Burry, investor and of “Big Short” fame, was an outspoken prophet of doom leading up to the housing market crash of 2008.\nSomething he said still rings true. When he noticed that the average home sales price was rocketing, but the median household income was unchanged, he recognized intuitively and accurately that the only thing accounting for the boom was leverage. Namely, individuals were indebted at rates far exceeding the norm.\nBurry later asked the Federal Reserve and Congress: “if I could predict the Great Recession, why couldn’t you?”\nThey responded with an FBI investigation into all of his correspondences going back to 2003.\rAt the end of their investigation, the Fed published a paper stating that the housing crash was entirely unpredictable. A “black-swan event”, they said.\nIt’s a good thing we have learned from those mistakes. Or have we?\nWhat you’re looking at is the same trend Burry identified in 2005, now reincarnated. And with a vengeance.\nRenowned Yale economist Robert Shiller is best known for his work in developing the Case-Shiller home price index. What his work found is that home prices, when adjusted for inflation, are rather stable, given a long enough time frame. This goes against the conventional wisdom that buying a house is an asset which appreciates in value, but his research has been shown to be true in the world of economics.\nWhile it is true that houses increase in nominal value, this is almost entirely due to inflation.\nWhat the Case-Shiller home price index currently shows is that homes are once again severely overpriced, and ripe for a correction.\nInflation and the Fed\rEvery American is aware of the impact that inflation has had on their personal finances. From soaring gas prices to wheat, inflation has reared its head everywhere.\nComing in at over 8%, we are at inflation levels which have not been seen in decades.\nContrary to popular belief, this has very little to do with Putin. Nor does it have as much to do with Biden as the political right would lead you to believe. To be sure, the “Build Back Better” plan would have been extremely negative for the inflation rate. But as it stands, the current situation has nothing to do with Trump, Biden or Putin.\nNo, it has everything to do with the Fed and monetary policy.\nMost people know very little about the Fed. I believe that’s a mistake you cannot afford to make, as the Fed has essentially dictated the direction of markets since their inception.\nHere we have a chart comparing the supply of M2 money with various metrics of inflation, such as the CPI and core CPI.\nIn laymen’s terms, M2 money represents all the money that is washing around in the economy. It’s a bit more nuanced than that, but it includes cash, checking accounts, and all “easily convertible near money”.\nIf you look closely at our chart, you will notice that M2 money supply spikes precede inflation rate increases with consistency.\nRecent increases in M2 supply such as 2001 and 2009 reflected mass injections of cash into the economy through various monetary policies the Fed pursued in order to aid economic growth following substantial crashes and economic hardships.\nMost recently, and most prominently, the Fed increased M2 supply to levels never before seen in the wake of COVID. By slashing interest rates to zero and pursuing aggressive quantitative easing programs, the Fed has had its desired affect of propping up markets and spurring economic growth.\nBut now the chickens have come home to roost. Inflation is off the charts.\nWhile the Fed spent the year gaslighting us, calling inflation “transitory”, those who have been paying attention have seen this coming for a long time.\nAnd while inflation will carry the news headlines, what few realize is that inflation is not the real worry.\nAs the strength of the US Dollar as the world reserve currency is the Fed’s primary mission and concern, they will use every tool they have to halt inflation. And they will succeed.\nIt’s how they do this that matters.\nThey’ll do this by raising interest rates, which will raise mortgage rates. This will take the demand out of the housing market. Prices will crash. Already mortgage rates have doubled from this time last year.\nThey’ll do this by letting bonds and US treasuries roll off their balance sheet. This will decrease the amount of cash in the economy drastically. Investors will become less speculative, as they have less spare cash to speculate with. Particularly big banks and investing firms. This will be a drag on the stock market.\nBut markets have survived Fed rate hikes and quantitative tightening before. The housing market is not nearly as precarious as 2008 either. While there is a housing bubble, it is not based on subprime mortgages.\nBut, there’s another problem. This one is far more concerning.\nThe Value is in the Cash Flows\rWhat determines the value of a stock? I encourage you to ponder this question seriously, as in it lies a key to detecting market bubbles.\nIs a stock’s value whatever people will pay for it?\nOr is it the company’s total valuation divided by the number of shares?\nWhile a stock’s price is both of these things, more fundamentally, a stock is worth the cash that the company is expected to bring in, both now and in the future.\nA stock is overvalued when it’s priced at a higher level than the amount of cash they will eventually end up bringing in. Basically, investors get too optimistic.\n(One way this would happen? A massive increase in the money supply, leading to consumers spending more. Consumers spending more boosts the corporate earnings. When the money supply drops as the Fed fights inflation, what happens next? Earnings drop; investor expectations are not met.)\nOne way that investors often use to gauge whether a stock is overvalued is the Price to Earnings ratio. Basically, it’s the market cap of the stock divided by the earnings of the company (or their profit).\nMore abstractly, it is the number of years that it will take to recoup the price you paid for the share at the time of purchase in corporate earnings.\nTaking a look at this chart, which I found here, we can see that P/E for the entire S\u0026amp;P 500 are rather elevated.\nAnother way to look at this is through the Shiller PE Ratio.\nThe astute observer will immediately notice extreme valuations often precipitate extreme market corrections. In fact, the Shiller PE almost always reverts from extremes eventually.\nJohn Hussman, a retired Stanford economist and hedge fund manager, argues convincingly that revenues are better predictors of future stock performance than earnings.\nIf one takes his analysis as true, we are in for a decade of slightly negative or flat returns.\nIn the process, I would not be at all surprised by a major market correction, followed by a multi-year period of recouping the losses.\nInvesting Wisely in Uncertain Times\rIn sum, investors are looking at a war in Europe, a housing bubble, an aggressive Fed, off the charts inflation, ongoing COVID related supply chain issues and extremely overvalued markets.\nCan markets push higher still? Absolutely. At the end of the day, the market can remain unpredictable longer than we can remain patient.\nMarkets will push higher as long as investors view overvalued stocks as better investments than cash.\nMarket corrections and crashes result when investors view cash as the best possible asset.\nBut, the savvy investor should consider if he is willing to risk a market crash in order to invest at record high valuations.\nIf the answer to that question is yes, he must be prepared for potentially spending years in the negative. Eventually, he is likely to come out on top.\nIf the answer to that question is no, that investor may very well find himself with the opportunity of a lifetime - to buy when all have sold.\nI continue to advocate for patience. You’ll hear from me when that opportunity of a lifetime presents itself.\nThe information in this article is not to be considered as financial advice, nor is the author a licensed financial advisor.

So said Nick Bostrom, Oxford University theoretical physicist and philosopher. Yeah, about that. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that machine learning doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as advertised in March Madness.\nAll jokes aside, I set out on a hopeful quest to build a predictive model, in the mold of Ken Pomeroy and Jeff Sagarin, to predict my March Madness Bracket for me. Gone were the hours of pouring over stats with paper and pen, or combing through NCAA data online to predict my winners. Now, I could spend an extra 20 hours making a computer do it for me.\nIn order to build my model, I employed the aid of R and hoopR. Without getting too much into the weeds of how I selected variables, the following were employed:\n home/away true shooting% turnover% free throw factor offensive and defensive rebound% field goal% three point% points per possession points per possession allowed scoring margin compared to expectation per game (did you beat that bad team by more than expected, or lose to Gonzaga by less than expected?) block% average possession difference defensive stats for all these  While some of these stats have overlap, my thought process was that if we knew efficiency per possession and total possessions, we could accurately predict the better team. We attempt to find differences in possessions through rebounds and turnovers, and efficiency metrics through shooting and free throw stats. I also included home/away as a variable and defensive versions of every stats, so that predictions account for the quality of defense on each side.\nWith the aid of my new holy grail of predictive variables, I employed a variety of statistical machine learning methods, including a random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and XGboost. While the SVM and XGboost added small fractions of accuracy, the computing power required made pursuing them unrealistic for me, as I hope to be able to update my projections easily mid-season.\nI landed on a simple logistic regression for the tournament, though I would prefer to use the random forest going forward, in order to better handle multi-colinearity. Both the random forest and the logistic regression performed very well on in-season data, accurately predicting the outcome of ~72% of games ahead of time. Per my calculations, this is in the same ballpark as KenPom and Sagarin\u0026rsquo;s ratings.\nOf course, on a 72% accuracy and with so many evenly-matched in the tournament, chaos is bound to happen. My initial bracket:\nMy machine learning model (~72% accuracy) fared well in conference tournaments. Time for the big dance. Percentages represent win probabilities.

Article to come later today https://t.co/4m5RWhw5PF pic.twitter.com/MImGLLsw87\n\u0026mdash; Collin Dougherty (@CollinD0ugherty) April 4, 2022  A performance of 59% on the matchups where I had both team\u0026rsquo;s right isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, but it\u0026rsquo;s a far cry from the 72% of the regular season. I\u0026rsquo;m hesitant to read too much into such a small sample size, but one observation I have made throughout the course of the post-season is a tendency for the model to overvalue teams from non-P6 conferences, such as Vermont and Murray State. Some improvements in how I go about adjusting for strength of schedule should help in this regard for next season.\nAnother consideration is adjusting for pace. We saw several teams struggle against St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s defense as they slowed the pace of the game drastically, allowing them to beat objectively better teams. Of course, no model will predict a team like St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s over Kentucky, but it seems reasonable that a team that uglies up the game should swing win probabilities a bit more in their favor relative to what we would expect. (Conversely, they may also make their win probability lower against teams we expect them to beat. Looking at you Wisconsin.)\nThe South region I predicted relatively well, but Houston\u0026rsquo;s 1 for 20 showing from behind the arc against Villanova likely changed the course of the tournament. Houston, who appeared to be the better team, just couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy a bucket, but that\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of the game. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the ability to predict 72% of games, but there is definitely room for improvement. I look forward to improving the model in the coming months ahead of the 2022 season.\n","date":1649030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649091637,"objectID":"85f4264097f56858ef39cff159da97af","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/how-i-used-machine-learning-to-solve-march-madness/","publishdate":"2022-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/how-i-used-machine-learning-to-solve-march-madness/","section":"featured","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Machine learning is the last invention that humanity will need to make\u0026rdquo;.

Yet the historic bull run which resulted in euphoria among retail investors is not going to last forever. Let’s take a look at history and global markets. If we’re lucky, we’ll be able to make some predictions about US markets in the coming years.\nThe S\u0026amp;P 500 has been around since the 19th century, but its first competitor we are interested in didn’t begin until 1970 - the DAX, a German index still important today. Since the DAX was founded, here are the returns of 10 major indices\nIf we look closely, we see that the returns generally just correlate to the length of time that the indices have been active. It’s much like how saving for retirement at 20 compounds much more than starting at 40. This is no different. We need to zoom in.\nFrom 1970 to 1980, the DAX and SPX were generally correlated, unsurprisingly. The US market’s S\u0026amp;P 500 outperformed by a large margin however. In 1980, the KOSPI was developed to track South Korean markets.\nFrom 1980 to 1990, KOSPI went on an absolute tear, making the US and Germany look like paupers in comparison. The DAX even got revenge from the previous decade, outperforming the SPX by nearly 100%. That’s interesting - reversion to the mean? Let’s keep digging and see.\nIn that same decade, several other indices came online. NI225 and HSI became relevant tracking Asian markets, while CAC40 tracked the French markets.\rIn the 90’s the HSI - the worst performer of the previous decade - destroyed the competition. KOSPI, the darling child, ended the decade down. More reversion - interesting. The SPX ended up middle of the pack again, even though it was in the dot com bubble.\nAt the turn of the century, a new darling emerged in Asia. Meanwhile, the SPX actually went on a tear compared to its peers. HSI became human again. The majority yielded negative returns after a scorching bull run the previous decade.\nLast decade, from 2010 to 2020, the 399001 index (Shenzen, China) went from best performer to worst. Meanwhile, US markets absolutely destroyed the competition. But notice - it wasn’t anything particularly special compared to other top performing indices in past decades.\nThe last 2 years aren’t enough to break down this decade, but the US run has continued.\nWhat do I take from all this? It seems clear to me that the best performers typically revert to normalcy - often through moving to the bottom of the pack over the next decade.\nConversely, bottom performers typically rise. It’s just a law of averages, really.\nBut what this implies for US equities is not the most exciting thing in the world. If the past repeats itself, it seems likely that US indices should perform worse than their global peers in the next decade or two.\rWhile some may panic and yell to “SHORT EVERYTHING”, the reality is more nuanced.\rEven when the top performers reverted to the mean, most of them go on to yield positive returns the following decade. It’s just that their competitors yielded even better returns\nTo be sure, a global recession would make all falter. Just as a global bull market would enable every ship to rise with the tide.\nAnyways, I look at all this data and leave with the undeniable impression that we should seek to rotate funds into markets outside of the US in the coming decade or two. It will be there that the best returns are likely to be found.\nTo be sure, the US markets can continue to rip for months, even years more. But the music must eventually stop. To believe otherwise is simply repeating the mistakes of those who came before us.\n","date":1644796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644876375,"objectID":"13351ada994e6b168aaf23fa0f72c053","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/on-u-s-markets-and-global-peers/","publishdate":"2022-02-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/on-u-s-markets-and-global-peers/","section":"featured","summary":"The US stock indexes have been on an incredible run compared to their global peers over the last decade.

Casey Thompson, who has two years of eligibility remaining, announced his commitment to Nebraska on Twitter last Friday.\n“Always got an ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt.” 🃏 Bet on yourself. Nebraska, let’s get it. #WhyNot #GBR pic.twitter.com/Ko0FHqhue2\n\u0026mdash; Casey Thompson (@LilThurm) January 7, 2022  The get is a big one for newly hired offensive coordinator Mark Whipple and 4 year head coach Scott Frost, who is coming off his third straight losing season and entering a win or go home season at Nebraska. Thompson, a Junior, comes in with significant starting experience from his time at Texas and will provide the Huskers with much needed maturity at the position.\nOn paper, Thompson was one of the best QB’s in the Big 12 in the 2021 season, completing 165/261 passes for 2113 yards and 24 touchdowns to 9 interceptions. Thompson comes to Nebraska with a near 64% completion rate and 30-9 TD/INT ratio. He finished the season with a QBR of 154.7, good for 26th in the nation.\nHe replaces Nebraska veteran Adrian Martinez, who recently announced a decision to transfer to Kansas State. Martinez, both loved and the object of fierce criticism at times, battled multiple shoulder injuries while at Nebraska. He often started seasons extremely well, only to re-injure his throwing shoulder mid-season. He frequently played through pain and adversity and was a great team leader but struggled in big moments.\nDuring his time at Nebraska, Martinez completed a solid 63.5% of his passes but struggled with a 45-30 TD/INT ratio. Martinez finished his career with a mediocre QBR of 139.5.\nCasey Thompson on Paper\rCasey Thompson did not initially find himself as the starter at Texas this season, coming in to replace Hudson Card against Arkansas. After that, Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian named Thompson the starter for each of the following 7 games.\nThompson started the season very well going 70/97 (72.2%) in his first 4 games as starter, with 13 TD’s to 3 INT’s. In his 4th game as starter against Oklahoma, he suffered a thumb injury on his throwing hand that plagued him for the rest of the season. After the Oklahoma game, the ball came out of his hand noticeably different, and he went just 91/151 (60.2%) with 10 touchdowns to 6 interceptions over the course of the following 6 games. Thompson would only play part of several of those 6 games, sharing time with Card as he struggled at times down the stretch.\nThompson never really looked himself after the thumb injury, with the ball coming out of his hand with noticeably less zip and accuracy. Despite that, he managed to lead the Longhorns to near upsets of Oklahoma State and Baylor. Though Thompson’s Longhorns struggled on the season, posting a 5-7 record, the woes are hard to pin on the Oklahoma City native, who led the Texas offense to 41 points per game on the days when he took the most snaps at QB.\nOn his career, prior to the thumb injury, Thompson was 99/139 (71.2%) with 20 touchdowns to 3 interceptions, posting a jaw dropping QBR of 200.4 in that span. That QBR would have placed him 2nd in the country in 2021, and 1st in 2020. Granted, his numbers are on significantly fewer plays than that of a full time starter, but it provides the best case scenario of what Thompson might be if he finds himself healthy with a full time role in Lincoln this fall.\nAnother ability that Thompson brings to the Huskers is an adeptness at evading pressure. In situations where Thompson had less than 2.5 seconds to get rid of the ball, he led the Big 12 in QBR, passing touchdowns, first downs, and was third in passing yardage. Thompson is a passing QB first, but is athletic enough to do damage with his legs, which he often used to avoid seemingly endless pressure. Texas’s offensive line struggled enormously this season, something which Nebraska fans can relate to. The Huskers are hoping for significant improvement in 2022, with experienced transfers Kevin Williams and Hunter Anthony joining Dominic Raiola’s revamped unit. If and when the offensive line struggles early in the season, Thompson will not be fazed, which is crucial to a successful offense for OC Mark Whipple.\nScouting Thompson on Film\r   On film, one thing that stands out about Thompson is his ability to go through his progressions. Husker fans have grown accustomed to quarterbacks who lock in on a target from before the snap, and Thompson will be a nice change of pace in that regard, quickly diagnosing defenses and throwing to the open man.\nWhen healthy, Thompson showed excellent touch on throws from the pocket, though his deep ball was inconsistent at times. For the fall season, Thompson will want to improve in this area.\nThompson also struggled with passing on the run or on bootlegs, something which Martinez often made look effortless. It will be important for him to throw in the pocket, and the better the offensive line is, the better he will be.\nLastly, Thompson struggled down the stretch and made several costly mistakes, none more costly than a pick-6 against Oklahoma State that likely cost the Longhorns the game. While Thompson was battling a thumb injury that made his throws significantly easier to defend, he will need to learn from mistakes made down the stretch mentally.\nThe Cornhuskers have found an intriguing prospect at QB, and Thompson looks fully set to start in 2022. He joins a QB room with returners Logan Smothers and Heinrich Haarberg, and the Huskers may look to add another QB from the transfer portal. Thompson has the attention of Husker nation going into the fall. Time will tell if he can get Frost’s alma mater over the hump.\n\r\r","date":1642032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642055599,"objectID":"379235cb223d4e218ba53cfb55102fb8","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/scouting-new-huskers-qb-casey-thompson/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/scouting-new-huskers-qb-casey-thompson/","section":"featured","summary":"After a long wait, the Huskers and Scott Frost have their quarterback for the 2022 season.

Frost has raised his total losses in one score games to 17 since becoming the coach at Nebraska, with a record of 5-17 in such contests. Husker fans continue to debate whether or not his team is making progress. Any progress that has been made is hidden underneath an ugly 3-5 record, placing the Huskers last in the Big Ten West. But under the surface, a much more optimistic picture does indeed appear.\nMany Nebraska fans have begun to complain louder and louder, and Frost’s seat is growing warmer by the loss. While Athletic Director Trev Alberts has expressed support and indicated that he is pleased with the improvements that have been made, many fans are left asking, “what improvements”? After all, the Huskers have a record of 3-5 as of today, and their best season was arguably Frost’s first.\nEvery season experiences fluke outcomes. Is it possible that Nebraska has just been really unlucky? Cursed, even? That’s the question we set out to answer today. Between calls of “joint possession” and “defensive delay of game”, there is reason to expect the Huskers have been at least a little unlucky.\nUsing data from collegefootballdata.com, I was able to run a simple linear regression which was able to predict 83% of 2019 games accurately in a backwards-looking fashion. For example, given all the games of 2019 and the stats of each game, it was able to correctly predict the outcome of the game, based only on its statistics, 83% of the time. The model is based on 3 factors which were highly predictive and independent: Predicted Points Added, Success Rate, and Explosiveness. I have dubbed this ‘The Triadic Model of College Football’. The three factors which make up the Triadic Model are briefly described here.\nPredicted Points Added: “PPA uses Expected Points to measure the outcome of a play. It takes the EP value from the beginning of a play (e.g. 2nd and 5 at the 50) and subtracts it from the EP value resulting from the play (e.g. rush for 10 yards results in 1st and 10 from the 40).” [Credit.]\nSuccess Rate: The success rate of a play is well defined in college football analytics circles. A successful play counts as any of the following:\r- Gaining 50% of the yardage to go on 1st down\r- Gaining 70% of the yardage to go on 2nd down\r- Gaining 100% of the yardage to go on 3rd down\rThe success rate is thus the number of successful plays divided by the sum of all plays.\nExplosiveness: “Explosiveness measures the average EPA on plays which were marked as successful. It uses this site’s EPA implementation (known as PPA).” [Credit.]\nIn sum, these three factors are all positively correlated with winning. More successful plays, explosiveness, and predicted points added all correlate to more points scored. The inverse applies for defenses. When running the Triadic Model, we can not only predict wins and losses, but even specific scores, with a high degree of accuracy. The Triadic Model is simple, it excludes garbage time (Garbage Time occurs when one of the following scenarios is met: Scoring margin is 38+ points in the 2nd quarter, 28+ points in the 3rd quarter, or 22+ points in the 4th quarter), and it doesn’t factor in turnovers or special teams, which are demonstrably key aspects of winning. But, sometimes simple models are just as good, and an 83% accuracy rating seems to point in this direction.\nAt some point in the future, I hope to incorporate turnover and special teams stats, which should help increase accuracy even more. It would also be worthwhile to consider garbage time stats, as a backwards-looking model is only interested in what actually happened. The model without garbage time stats should come in handy later on, when looking to predict how a team will do in future games. By way of example, the current model is known to underestimate scoring margins in blowouts because of the exclusion of garbage time stats.\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into what the Triadic Model has to say about the Huskers 2021 season.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial,

23\rMichigan\r29 - 32\r30 - 29\rMichigan State\r20 - 23\r30 - 21\rMinnesota\r23 - 30\r26 - 30\rBuffalo\r28 - 3\r39 - 18\rOklahoma\r16 - 23\r28 - 42\rNorthwestern\r56 - 7\r60 - 28\rFordham\r52 - 7\r35 - 33\r\r\rBy: Collin Dougherty\r\r\r\r\rPerhaps unsurprisingly, the model indicates Nebraska has indeed underperformed. What may come as a surprise to many, however, is the margin by which that underperformance has come. Our model predicts a 6-2 record for the Cornhuskers. Given the strength of schedule faced to date (TeamRankings currently says it ranks 13th in difficulty, FPI currently ranks it 5th), the Huskers have played remarkably well. With a 6-2 record, a top 15 rating would likely follow. And yet the Huskers receive no votes for the top 25, sitting instead at a lowly 3-5, last in the Big Ten West.\nThe model predicts a nail-biting win against Michigan, a blowout win over Illinois, and a comfortable win against Michigan State on the road. It also feels confident the Huskers laid an egg against Minnesota, with a predicted loss on the road, and suggests maybe the Huskers were lucky to keep Oklahoma within one score based on how they played.\nLet’s visualize the Huskers season further. Instead of looking at total yardage gained and allowed, we will look at yards per play and yards per play allowed. These stats help take into account pace of play and provide a more accurate picture of how a team is playing.\nNebraska, perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, finds itself among the better teams in college football when looking at YPP. But zooming in, we may be surprised at just how good their company is.\nThe Huskers nearest comparisons in YPP? #1. Georgia(7-0), #4. Ohio State(6-1), #2. Cincinnati(7-0), #3 Alabama(7-0), #8. Michigan State(7-0), #16 Baylor(6-1), #22. Iowa State(5-2), and only one unranked team, Florida(4-3), yes, the same Florida that took Alabama to the wire.\nLooking even deeper, we see that not only has Nebraska badly underperformed, it is in fact one of only 3 teams to do so at such a dramatic clip this season, joining the ranks of Florida State and Western Kentucky.\nhtml {\rfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',

a reversion to winning 50% of those games, as is typical in football, or going 11-11, would place his record at 21-19.\nThe Husker pundits will continue debating what needs to be changed - culture, offensive line, special teams, etc. - and rightfully so. The Huskers have several glaring holes that can be greatly improved. But it seems they have everything they need to perform at a highly successful level in the here and now. I leave the question then to the reader: is Nebraska cursed? Or is this just who they are?\n","date":1635120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635214233,"objectID":"e1b538ffe45a9c7b79739564c5a1e1b8","permalink":"https://collindougherty.github.io/featured/nebraska-cursed-or-consistent/","publishdate":"2021-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/featured/nebraska-cursed-or-consistent/","section":"featured","summary":"The 2021 season has been quintessential Nebraska football under Scott Frost.
