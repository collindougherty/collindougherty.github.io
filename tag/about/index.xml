&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Pure Signal. When I was in the midst of my college career, I became fascinated by the way stock markets and crypto markets moved. Like many of my other passions, trying to make sense of the seeming randomness enamored me. I share many of my insights here as I refine old methods and forge new ones. Assets donâ€™t move randomly. Under the surface, if you look closely enough, you can distinguish the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Forecaster, home of Collin Dougherty&amp;rsquo;s data driven insights (and occasional rambles). On the site you can find a host of different topics covered, including stock markets, cryptocurrencies, baseball, football, basketball and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seek to use data and statistical machine learning to derive useful insights in all of these topics and more, whether it be a stock market trade idea or a prediction for a team&amp;rsquo;s performance in March Madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I encourage you to check out my Twitter, where I post much more frequently and on an even wider variety of topics. My articles often make the most sense in that context. Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CollinD0ugherty&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
