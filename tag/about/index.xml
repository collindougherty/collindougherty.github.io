&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Pure Signal. When I was in the midst of my college career, I became fascinated by the way stock markets and crypto markets moved. Like many of my other passions, trying to make sense of the seeming randomness enamored me. I share many of my insights here as I refine old methods and forge new ones. Assets donâ€™t move randomly. Under the surface, if you look closely enough, you can distinguish the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
