        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>The Hedonic treadmill. Habituation.</p>
            <p>This is how our brains are designed to function. There’s a logical reason for this in that constant seeking usually improves our survival.</p>
            <p>But I find its existence less interesting than its implications.</p>
            <p>If you are always going to return to your hedonic baseline, then you should probably make the baseline as automatic as breathing.</p>
            <p>Modern societies don’t function this way. In order to maintain our baseline of happiness we require a big house, green lawn, beautiful driveway, perfectly painted rooms, interior decoration, the best streaming platforms, social media, alcohol, paid time off, vacations, a constantly changing personally curated playlist of songs that specifically appeals to our unique mental makeup…</p>
            <p>All this before any of the important psychological dimensions of being a human.</p>
            <p>We have all these perks and are less happy than ever.</p>
            <p>Most people think the lower levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs are fulfilled today like never before. But what if we have just redefined the lower levels of the pyramid to require more than ever?</p>
            <p>And what would happen if we set a new baseline?</p>
            <p>Is it possible that with a new baseline, you would come to appreciate the taste of healthy food, or the intrinsic joy in meaningful work?</p>
            <p>The minimalist movement gets some of this right, but doesn’t go nearly far enough.</p>
            <p>You need to re-baseline your technology usage, your free time, your definition of work and what you eat and drink.</p>
            <p>Some will say this is missing out on the best of modern society.</p>
            <p>I couldn’t disagree more.</p>
            <p>By re-baselining, you free yourself.</p>
            <p>By becoming free, the perks of the modern world become wonders once more.</p>
