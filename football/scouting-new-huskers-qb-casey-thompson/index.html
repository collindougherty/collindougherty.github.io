<p>After a long wait, the Huskers and Scott Frost have their quarterback for the 2022 season. Casey Thompson, who has two years of eligibility remaining, announced his commitment to Nebraska on Twitter last Friday.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Always got an ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt.” 🃏 Bet on yourself. Nebraska, let’s get it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhyNot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WhyNot</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GBR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GBR</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ko0FHqhue2">pic.twitter.com/Ko0FHqhue2</a></p>&mdash; Casey Thompson (@LilThurm) <a href="https://twitter.com/LilThurm/status/1479564325970919428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<p>The get is a big one for newly hired offensive coordinator Mark Whipple and 4 year head coach Scott Frost, who is coming off his third straight losing season and entering a win or go home season at Nebraska. Thompson, a Junior, comes in with significant starting experience from his time at Texas and will provide the Huskers with much needed maturity at the position.</p>
<p>On paper, Thompson was one of the best QB’s in the Big 12 in the 2021 season, completing 165/261 passes for 2113 yards and 24 touchdowns to 9 interceptions. Thompson comes to Nebraska with a near 64% completion rate and 30-9 TD/INT ratio. He finished the season with a QBR of 154.7, good for 26th in the nation.</p>
<p>He replaces Nebraska veteran Adrian Martinez, who recently announced a decision to transfer to Kansas State. Martinez, both loved and the object of fierce criticism at times, battled multiple shoulder injuries while at Nebraska. He often started seasons extremely well, only to re-injure his throwing shoulder mid-season. He frequently played through pain and adversity and was a great team leader but struggled in big moments.</p>
<p>During his time at Nebraska, Martinez completed a solid 63.5% of his passes but struggled with a 45-30 TD/INT ratio. Martinez finished his career with a mediocre QBR of 139.5.</p>
<div id="casey-thompson-on-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>Casey Thompson on Paper</h2>
<p>Casey Thompson did not initially find himself as the starter at Texas this season, coming in to replace Hudson Card against Arkansas. After that, Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian named Thompson the starter for each of the following 7 games.</p>
<p>Thompson started the season very well going 70/97 (72.2%) in his first 4 games as starter, with 13 TD’s to 3 INT’s. In his 4th game as starter against Oklahoma, he suffered a thumb injury on his throwing hand that plagued him for the rest of the season. After the Oklahoma game, the ball came out of his hand noticeably different, and he went just 91/151 (60.2%) with 10 touchdowns to 6 interceptions over the course of the following 6 games. Thompson would only play part of several of those 6 games, sharing time with Card as he struggled at times down the stretch.</p>
<p>Thompson never really looked himself after the thumb injury, with the ball coming out of his hand with noticeably less zip and accuracy. Despite that, he managed to lead the Longhorns to near upsets of Oklahoma State and Baylor. Though Thompson’s Longhorns struggled on the season, posting a 5-7 record, the woes are hard to pin on the Oklahoma City native, who led the Texas offense to 41 points per game on the days when he took the most snaps at QB.</p>
<p>On his career, prior to the thumb injury, Thompson was 99/139 (71.2%) with 20 touchdowns to 3 interceptions, posting a jaw dropping QBR of 200.4 in that span. That QBR would have placed him 2nd in the country in 2021, and 1st in 2020. Granted, his numbers are on significantly fewer plays than that of a full time starter, but it provides the best case scenario of what Thompson might be if he finds himself healthy with a full time role in Lincoln this fall.</p>
<p>Another ability that Thompson brings to the Huskers is an adeptness at evading pressure. In situations where Thompson had less than 2.5 seconds to get rid of the ball, he led the Big 12 in QBR, passing touchdowns, first downs, and was third in passing yardage. Thompson is a passing QB first, but is athletic enough to do damage with his legs, which he often used to avoid seemingly endless pressure. Texas’s offensive line struggled enormously this season, something which Nebraska fans can relate to. The Huskers are hoping for significant improvement in 2022, with experienced transfers Kevin Williams and Hunter Anthony joining Dominic Raiola’s revamped unit. If and when the offensive line struggles early in the season, Thompson will not be fazed, which is crucial to a successful offense for OC Mark Whipple.</p>
<div id="scouting-thompson-on-film" class="section level3">
<h3>Scouting Thompson on Film</h3>
<p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fykzcXgS3FY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>On film, one thing that stands out about Thompson is his ability to go through his progressions. Husker fans have grown accustomed to quarterbacks who lock in on a target from before the snap, and Thompson will be a nice change of pace in that regard, quickly diagnosing defenses and throwing to the open man.</p>
<p>When healthy, Thompson showed excellent touch on throws from the pocket, though his deep ball was inconsistent at times. For the fall season, Thompson will want to improve in this area.</p>
<p>Thompson also struggled with passing on the run or on bootlegs, something which Martinez often made look effortless. It will be important for him to throw in the pocket, and the better the offensive line is, the better he will be.</p>
<p>Lastly, Thompson struggled down the stretch and made several costly mistakes, none more costly than a pick-6 against Oklahoma State that likely cost the Longhorns the game. While Thompson was battling a thumb injury that made his throws significantly easier to defend, he will need to learn from mistakes made down the stretch mentally.</p>
<p>The Cornhuskers have found an intriguing prospect at QB, and Thompson looks fully set to start in 2022. He joins a QB room with returners Logan Smothers and Heinrich Haarberg, and the Huskers may look to add another QB from the transfer portal. Thompson has the attention of Husker nation going into the fall. Time will tell if he can get Frost’s alma mater over the hump.</p>
